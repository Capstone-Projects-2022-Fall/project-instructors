# Requirements Documentation

Once you have setup the GitHub Repo, and submitted the *Team Git Repository Creation* assignment, you will be work on your Requirements Document located in the `documentation/docs/requirements/` directory. This document encapsulates everything that makes up your project. Features, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements. This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.


The requirements specification document should contain the following sections:

- System Overview
- System Block Diagram
- Document Overview
- General Requirements
- Features and Requirements
- Use-case descriptions:
    - For each use-case define the triggering event and the interactions between the actor and the system. Normal and alternate flows should be described.
    - As an alternative to use-cases, user stories may be used, provided they are accompanied by scenarios that can form the basis for acceptance testing.
    - diagram or some other diagram that identifies the external interfaces. External interfaces include the user and external hardware or software.


Revise the Project Proposal document template.

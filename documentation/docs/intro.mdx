# Project Documentation and Repository

Documentation is a critical part of software projects. Think about it. When you're researching the tools you need for your projects, your more likely to use the one that has documentation and a community that is actively using it. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file you're likely to just skip it, because you don't even know where to start. Large companies also expect you to document your code, so that management can add more team members when necessary, and so that 20 years down the road, they can maintain it.

Many companies and open source projects are using a tool called Docusaurus, an open source tool for writing and maintaining documentation by Meta. Documentation is written in markdown files in the `documentation/docs/` directory. If you've never written Markdown before, its incredibly easy. 

## Quick Markdown Tutorial

Markdown is just a simple textfile that Docusaurus can interpret and convert into a pretty webpage. 

```markdown
# This is a heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3
```

# This is a heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3

Heading 2 in docusuarus appears in the right hand sidebar as a table of contents with heading 3s as their children. For this class, that should largley be the only thing you need to know unless you want your documentation to look fancier. We will likely play around with some of the fancy features of docusaurus later in the semester. If you wish to learn more now you can go to the [docusaurus tutorial section](/tutorial/intro) of your documentation website, or go to [Docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) to view Markdown Features. 

## Requirements Documentation

For this assignment you will be working on your Requirements Document. This document encapsulates everything that makes up your project. Features, use cases, user stories. This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.


The requirements specification document should contain the following sections:

- System Overview
- System Block Diagram
- Document Overview
- General Requirements
- Features and Requirements
- Use-case descriptions:
    - For each use-case define the triggering event and the interactions between the actor and the system. Normal and alternate flows should be described. 
    - As an alternative to use-cases, user stories may be used, provided they are accompanied by scenarios that can form the basis for acceptance testing.
    - diagram or some other diagram that identifies the external interfaces. External interfaces include the user and external hardware or software.
 

Revise the Project Proposal document template.

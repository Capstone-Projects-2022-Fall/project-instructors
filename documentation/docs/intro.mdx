# Project Documentation and Repository

Documentation is a critical part of software projects. Think about it. When you're researching the tools you need for your projects, your more likely to use the one that has documentation and a community that is actively using it. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file you're likely to just skip it, because you don't even know where to start. Large companies also expect you to document your code, so that management can add more team members when necessary, and so that 20 years down the road, they can maintain it.

Many companies and open source projects are using a tool called Docusaurus, an open source tool for writing and maintaining documentation by Meta. Documentation is written in markdown files in the `documentation/docs/` directory. If you've never written Markdown before, it's incredibly easy.

## Quick Markdown Tutorial

Markdown is just a simple textfile that Docusaurus can interpret and convert into a pretty webpage.

```markdown
# This is a heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3
```

# This is a heading 1

## This is a heading 2

### This is a heading 3

Heading 2 in Docusuarus appears in the right-hand sidebar as a table of contents with heading 3s as their children. For this class, that should largely be the only thing you need to know unless you want your documentation to look fancier. We will likely play around with some fancy features of docusaurus later in the semester. If you wish to learn more now you can go to the [docusaurus tutorial section](/tutorial/intro) of your documentation website, or go to [Docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) to view Markdown Features.

## Setting up the project

1. [Click here to join the GitHub Classroom and get the starter project.](https://classroom.github.com/a/q3itl4oR)
2. Login to your GitHub Account (we recommend you use your personal account for resume building.)
3. Select your name and TUEmail from the list.
4. Select your team or create it if it's not listed.

### GitHub Build Environment Setup

In order for your Documentation Website to build you need to fill a few environment "Secrets" into the project. **ONLY ONE STUDENT HAS TO DO THIS!**

1. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and click "Settings" in the dropdown.
2. Scroll all the way to the bottom and on the left side click "Devleoper Settings"
3. Click "Personal access tokens" then click "Generate new token" on the right.
4. Select the following privileges and make the expiration date the date of the course end. (This is just for security purposes)
![select token privileges repo, workflow, admin read:org](../static/img/token-privlages.png)
5. Copy your token to clipboard (make sure it's copied because it won't be retrievable when you leave the page.) ![Copy your token](../static/img/copy-token.png)
6. Go back to your project repository. Click the settings tab. Now you're going to add the token you copied to the project. Click Secrets under Security > Secrets > Actions. Click new repository secret.
![Add TOKEN to project](../static/img/add-token-to-project.png)
You also need to make one last secret called USER which will contain your GitHub Username.
7. Deploy the website. Start by clicking the Actions Tab. You should see a Workflow called "Deploy Docs" with a failed job called "Add online IDE url". Click the failed job. Click "Re-run jobs" then Re-run failed jobs.

8. Once the job is complete you will see an Environments section that says "github-pages" with a ðŸš€. Click it. Then click "View deployment"

9. Check out your new site!

## Requirements Documentation

For this assignment you will be working on your Requirements Document. This document encapsulates everything that makes up your project. Features, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements. This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.


The requirements specification document should contain the following sections:

- System Overview
- System Block Diagram
- Document Overview
- General Requirements
- Features and Requirements
- Use-case descriptions:
    - For each use-case define the triggering event and the interactions between the actor and the system. Normal and alternate flows should be described.
    - As an alternative to use-cases, user stories may be used, provided they are accompanied by scenarios that can form the basis for acceptance testing.
    - diagram or some other diagram that identifies the external interfaces. External interfaces include the user and external hardware or software.


Revise the Project Proposal document template.

A sample Requirements document [TempleCatsRequirementsDoc_13_2.docx](https://templeu.instructure.com/courses/114202/files/19367286?wrap=1)  provided  here for your reference.

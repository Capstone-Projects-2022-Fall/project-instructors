  "description": "Documentation is a critical part of software projects. Think about it. When you're researching the tools you need for your projects, you're more likely to use the one that has documentation and a community that is actively using it. If you see a project on GitHub with no README file you're likely to just skip it, because you don't even know where to start. Large companies also expect you to document your code, so that management can add more team members when necessary, and so that 20 years down the road, they can maintain it.",

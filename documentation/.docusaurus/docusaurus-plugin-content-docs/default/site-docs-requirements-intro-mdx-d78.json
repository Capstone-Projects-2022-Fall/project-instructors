This document encapsulates everything that makes up your project. Features, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements. This is the very first design document of your project. It serves as a contract between your project team and the project stakeholders. The Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the product. Those requirements will be verified as a measurement of the project success or failure.",
